If you plan to prepare the package distribution, then configure the project to
import cli, html2ps, and ps2pdf14 programs. This makes sure that the presence
of these programs is not optional anymore and thus the package distribution is
guaranteed to contain all the documentation files. For example:

$ b configure: config.cli=.../cli config.html2ps=html2ps \
  config.ps2pdf14=ps2pdf14
