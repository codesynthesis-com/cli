General
-------

Unless you are using the cli+dep package, you will also need to install
the following dependencies:

  libcutl >= 1.0.0 http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/libcutl/

Additionally for UNIX-like operating systems:

  build   >= 0.3.4 http://kolpackov.net/projects/build/

The cli+dep package comes with the necessary dependencies bundled.


UNIX
----

Building on UNIX-like operating systems requires GNU make 3.81 or later.
Most recent GNU/Linux distributions should already have this version
installed. To check the GNU make version run make (or gmake) with the
--version option.

To build the compiler, tests, and examples simply run make in the root
directory of the package. To run the automated tests, run 'make test'.
To clean the object files, executables, etc., run 'make clean'. To de-
configure the package (that is, remove configuration files in addition
to objects, executables, etc.), run 'make disfigure'.


Windows
-------

Project and solution files are provided for Visual C++ 8.0 (2005) and 
9.0 (2008). To build the CLI compiler, open and build the corresponding
solution file in the cli\ directory. After the build is complete, the
compiler executable can be found in the cli\ directory. You can also
build examples by opening and building one of the solution files in the
examples\ directory.
