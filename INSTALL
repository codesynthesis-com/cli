General
-------

Unless you are using the cli+dep package, you will also need to install
the following dependencies:

  libcutl >= 1.0.0 http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/libcult/

Additionally for UNIX-like operating systems:

  build   >= 0.3.4 http://kolpackov.net/projects/build/

The cli+dep package comes with the necessary dependencies bundled.


UNIX
----

Building on UNIX-like operating systems requires GNU make 3.81 or later.
Most recent GNU/Linux distributions should already have this version
installed. To check the GNU make version run make (or gmake) with the
--version option.

To build the compiler, tests, and examples simply run make in the root
directory of the package. To run the automated tests, run 'make test'.
To clean the object file, executables, etc., run 'make clean'. To de-
configure the package (that is, remove configuration files in addition
to objects, executables, etc.), run 'make disfigure'.


Windows
-------

Project and solution files for Visual C++ will be provided in the future.
For now, you can create an empty console project and add all the source
files in the cli/ directory to it.
