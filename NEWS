Version 1.1.0

  * Support for option documentation. Option documentation is used to print 
    the usage information as well as to generate the program documentation in
    the HTML and man page formats. For details, see Sections 2.5, "Adding
    Documentation" and 3.3, "Option Documentation" in the Getting Started 
    Guide. New CLI compiler command line options related to this feature: 

    --suppress-usage
    --long-usage
    --option-length
    --generate-cxx
    --generate-man
    --generate-html
    --man-prologue
    --man-epilogue
    --html-prologue
    --html-epilogue
    --man-suffix
    --html-suffix
    --class 
    --stdout

    The CLI compiler usage, HTML documentation, and man page are auto-generated
    using this feature.

  * New option, --generate-modifier, triggers the generation of the option
    value modifiers in addition to the accessors.

  * Support for erasing the parsed elements from the argc/argv array. See
    Section 3.1, "Option Class Definition" in the Getting Started Guide for
    more information.

  * New scanner interface. Starting with this version, the option class has 
    a new constructor which accepts an abstract scanner interface. See Section
    3.1, "Option Class Definition" in the Getting Started Guide for more 
    information.

  * New option, --generate-file-scanner, triggers the generation of the 
    argv_file_scanner scanner implementation which provides support for 
    reading command line arguments from the argv array as well as files
    specified with command line options. For more information see Section 
    3.1, "Option Class Definition" in the Getting Started Guide as well as
    the 'file' example.

  * New option, --options-file, allows additional CLI command line options
    to be provided in files (implemented using argv_file_scanner).

Version 1.0.0

  * First public release.
